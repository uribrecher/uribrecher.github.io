title:  "Screen addiction"
dir: ltr
---

In our world of everything social: social distancing, social dilemma, social justice,
it is almost too easy to overflow our minds in an endless feed of loud and overbearing words and images.
During confinement periods, the screen may seem like an inevitable choice. 
Although we might mistake all this a harmless virtual walk in the park,
it may become a genuine addiction with all the usual symptoms.
Our emotions become desensitized; our minds develop tolerance,
and we find ourselves needing and using more and more.

We spend less time in the real world. We neglect intimacy, touch, curiosity, patience, anticipation.
I recently decided to reduce my screen-time usage, and I can feel the positive effects it has on me.
I try to spend more time talking to people in person, make shorter work sessions
(I work sitting at a desk in front of a screen), with many short breaks to move my body,
change my view, breathe some fresh air.
I do daily walks in our nearby woods, meditate,
and I started practicing Pilates and Yoga (on zoom)every week.
Recently we bought some plants, and I spent some time gardening.
It feels great to use my body more and to use my senses in such a direct way that it is not
possible in front of a screen.

For this post I am challenging myself writing in a foreign language.
I assume there is a lot of room for improvement,
but I guess that's what it means to take the first step.
